## 🔄 Where I Am in My ML Workflow

✅ **Step 1 — Framing the Problem**  
*I learned how to define ML problems clearly and figure out exactly what I want to predict.*

🟢 **Step 2 — Gathering Data (current focus)**  
*Right now, I’m diving into all the ways data can be collected:*  
- 📄 Flat files (**CSV**, **JSON**)  
- 🗄️ Databases (**SQL**, **SSMS**)  
- 🌐 APIs  
- 🕸️ Web scraping (**BeautifulSoup, Requests**)  

⏳ **Step 3 — Data Cleaning & Preparation (coming next…)**  

> 💡 *Pro tip:* Collecting **good quality data** makes all the next steps in ML smoother. Garbage in → Garbage out!

## 🛠️ Tools in My ML Toolkit

- 🐍 **Python 3** — Main programming language  
- 🐼 **Pandas** — Data handling & analysis  
- 🗄️ **SQL (SQLite3 + SSMS)** — Querying databases  
- 📄 **JSON** — File format handling  
- 🌐 **Requests & BeautifulSoup4** — Web scraping  

> ✨ *I’m practicing data collection in multiple formats to prepare for the tougher ML steps ahead.*

## 🎯 Why I’m Doing This

Before I can **clean, model, or deploy**, I must first **master the art of gathering data**.  

> 📝 *This repo is my sandbox — a place to experiment, make mistakes, and truly understand data collection.*
